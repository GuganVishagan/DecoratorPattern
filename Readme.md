Decorator Pattern Coffee Example


This repository demonstrates the Decorator Design Pattern in Java. The Decorator Pattern allows adding functionality to objects dynamically without altering their structure, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.

Features:
Base Coffee interface for different types of coffee.
SimpleCoffee as a basic implementation.
Decorators (MilkDecorator, SugarDecorator, etc.) to extend functionality dynamically.
Why use it?
Avoids subclass explosion by combining behaviors dynamically.
Keeps the code flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain.
Run the Code:
Clone the repository.
Navigate to Main.java.
Run it to see how coffee descriptions and costs change with added features.
Perfect for learning the Decorator Pattern in a simple and practical way!
